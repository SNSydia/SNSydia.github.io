            <h2>Hello Cynthia, </h2>
            <p>I have to say - I had a lot of fun decorating for christmas with you, and I also had a lot of fun taking christmas pictures of us and our
				decorative creations. Christmas is by far the most meaningful time of the year for me so naturally I enjoyed our time together very much so.
				And that time spent together had me thinking about a whole lot of things about us together in the future... among them are the many christmases together yet to come,
				and how much I truly desire to better myself and become best version of myself in every way I can be. And of course one of those things is my pursuit of a career as a
				software engineer. So while trying to get back into programming, I figured it would be a neat little idea to create a digital album of our times spent together. 
				So I decided to make a photo gallery of meaningful moments to us which can be easily viewed or shared with others! So I hope you can take this little gift of mine to
				the both of as a testiment towards taking the first of many steps in order to get settled into a good career and also become a functional human being. This, like myself, are both
				works in progress. They're not perfect by any means, but I am quite certain they'll get better over time :) 
			
			</p>
			<p>
				I hope that you enjoy my efforts in creating this. Just like decorating for christmas, making this was also a lot of fun! I love you sooo much, Cynthia. Again, getting
				to spend time with you and help you prep your home into the christmas spirit was both very enjoyable and meanful to me to get to spend such special and intimate time
				doing something we both enjoy. I love you and hope you have a very merry christmas! 
			</p>
